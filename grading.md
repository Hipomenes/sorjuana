# Participation (30%)

This course is **not a lecture but a seminar**: you are expected to do all readings, elaborate questions about the texts and their contexts, and actively participate in class discussions. Your participation grade will be affected by your attendance, punctuality to class, and above all by your **active engagement** in class discussions.

# Oral presentations (10%)
You will do a presentation throughout the semester. You can use Power Point or write a presentation outline to be shared with the class. The presenter will lead class discussion, and prepare a class activity. 

# Writings Assignments (30%)

You will write two kinds of assignments: compositions and reactions. **Compositions** are formal written assignments of around 750-1000 words. You will write six of these, roughly one every two weeks, based on prompts provided by the professor. Compositions will be graded, corrected and re-submitted, which will allow you to raise your grade. **Reactions** are short, 1-3 paragraphs critical responses. There are no prompts for these and will not be graded nor corrected. All written work will be submitted through Blackboard.

# Midterm (10%)

There will be a midterm exam with source identification and a short essay question.

# Final Paper (20%)

The final paper will be 8-10 pages, double-spaced, Times New Roman font, 12 pt, 1" margins, using the MLA citation format. The paper will analyze 2-3 texts read during the semester; you will engage with them critically and in a framework of your choosing (a central question, issue or theme). The paper should have a clear argument or thesis, provide essential contextual information, and develop a close reading of the sources. You need to discuss the idea and plan of the paper with me in a few weeks before the paper is due, failing to do so will affect your grade. Deductions apply if you hand in the essay late.
