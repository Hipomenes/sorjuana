# Participation (20%)

This course is **not a lecture but a seminar**: you are expected to do all readings, elaborate questions about the texts and their contexts, and actively participate in class discussions. Your participation grade will be affected by your attendance, punctuality to class, and above all by your **active engagement** in class discussions.

# Oral presentations (20%)

You will do **one "kickoff" presentation** (10-15 min) and **two keyword presentations** (5 min) throghout the semester. The kickoff---a football metaphor---implies that the presenter is responsible for getting the game started. Ths type of presentation does not require you to provide historical or biographical information culled from Wikipedia, and does not require any Power Point. Instead, the kickoff presentation requires a careful and detailed reading of the work, and should offer a brief critical commentary as well as mapping out a number of key topics and questions for class discussi√≥n. The presenter will then lead class discussion for another 10-15 minutes. Keyword presentations are brief, casual and conversational presentations on keywords suggested by the professor every week. 

# Writings Assignments (30%)

You will write two kinds of assignments: compositions and reactions. **Compositions** are formal written assignments of around 750-1000 words. You will write six of these, roughly one every two weeks, based on prompts provided by the professor. Compositions will be graded, corrected and re-submitted, which will allow you to raise your grade. **Reactions** are short, 1-3 parragraphs critical responses. There are no prompts for these and will not be graded nor corrected. All written work will be submitted through Blackboard.

# Final Paper (30%)

The final paper will be 8-10 pages, double-spaced, Times New Roman font, 12 pt, 1" margins, using the MLA citation format. The paper will analyze 2-3 texts read during the semester; you will engage with them critically and in a framework of your choosing (a central question, issue or theme). The paper should have a clear argument or thesis, provide essential contextual information, and develop a close reading of the sources. You need to discuss the idea and plan of the paper with me in a few weeks before the paper is due, failing to do so will affect your grade. Deductions apply if you hand in the essay late.
